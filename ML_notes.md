# ML Lectures Notes

### Overview of Machine Learning - Mahesan Niranjan

Spoke about the development of data and examples of this. Examples of data with and without targets - in particular mentioning investigating spread 
of this data. Also mentioned the high dimensional space associated with experimental datasets. Supervised vs. Unsupervised.


Predictions are not rational when having a overtly complicated function approximator. To make this more reasonable, add regularization.

'Curse of Dimensionality'

To maintain the same accuracy at higher and higher densities you need expenentionally more data.

### Machine Learning: Estimation - Mahesan Niranjan

Frequentist thought vs. Bayesian thought.

Different correlations of data:

- Data not correlated = clump.
- Data linearally correlated = line to the effect of y = x.
- y equals a relatively consistent x.

### Classification: Mahesan Niranjan

X vs. y with two plots of high/low pairs that overlap. Can store as a vector of both class 1 and class 2.
